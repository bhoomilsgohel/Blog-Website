# Daily-Journal-App
A daily blog/Journal app to store your daily pieces of writing.
Created a web app with the focus on backend. Used simple bootstrap for the fronted and NodeJS and ExpressJS along with MongoDB as the database for the backend.

Go to /compose to start writing a new journal.
Go to /posts/_yourjournaltitle_ to view an already existing piece of writing.
